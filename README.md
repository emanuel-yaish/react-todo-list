# react-todo-list

Demo: https://lovely-salamander-0e02f2.netlify.app/

I did a job interview and one of the task was to build a Todo List, I didn't finish it during the time I got in the interview so I decided to repeat the mission for the next time that I will need to build one of these because I know in that way the next time I will need to build it will be faster.
